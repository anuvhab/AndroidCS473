Problem Description

To create the app ImplicitIntentActivity, I used camera app and sending email app.

Camera app: By clicking the CAMERA Button, it opens the camera application thus built in in the system
We can click the picture and after that that picture is displayed in the ImageViewer in that Activity window.

Send Email: We can send email by clicking the EMAIL button which opens the email application thus built in in the system.
